# Algorithms and DS Interview Preparation

I was learning algorithms and data structures with brute force method.
Learned, read, solved all that i found about algorithms. I will try new method

* Learn from basic topics
* Practice every topic after understanding one go to another topic
* Learn every data structure from easy to advanced
* Learn every algorithm from easy to advanced
* Learn coding interview patterns
* Practice in leetcode by topics
