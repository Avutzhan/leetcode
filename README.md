# Algorithms and DS Interview Preparation

I was learning algorithms and data structures with **Brute Force** method.
Learned, read, solved all that I found about algorithms. Brute Force not effective and quick way of learning.

I will try new method **Divide and Conquer**. This method must be quick and effective learning way.

* Focus on one programming language (python)
* Learn from basic topics
* Practice every topic after understanding one go to another topic
* Learn every data structure from easy to advanced
* Learn every algorithm from easy to advanced
* Learn coding interview patterns
* Practice in leetcode by topics
  * in this step you must know every ds and algo and problem-solving techniques
  * here you must just solve leetcode problems and don't have any questions about fundamentals
  * we must practice FAST problem-solving
* After this will be System Design learning path, but it is another story

## Project structure

* Learn
  * will contain all solutions 
  * also not efficient and slow solutions to learn from zero and step by step we will make them better
  * before every code session understand problem and explain it on whiteboard by drawing simple steps to solve
* Practice (implement and practice every day untill you can explain and implement code by yourself)
  * will contain epmty functions that you will implement and test
  * write code and run python -m unittest -v tests/test_name.py
* Tests
  * will contain ready tests
* Readme Learning path

::TODO replace with Algorithms and Data structures Roadmap (Ordered by easy to advance)

### Books:
1. Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
   * Introduction to algorithms and data structures for beginners

### Courses:
1. Educative - Data Structures for Coding Interviews in Python
   * Fundamentals of data structures with python for beginners

### Data Structures:
* Lists

### Algorithms:

| # | Category  | Title         | Time     | Space   | Data Structure |
|---|-----------|---------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Search    | linear search | O(n^2)   | O(1)    | List           |
| 2 | Search    | binary search | O(logn)  | O(1)    | List           |
| 3 | Sort      | select sort   | O(n^2)   | O(n)    | List           |
| 4 | Sort      | quick sort    | O(n^2)   | O(n^2)  | List           |
| 5 | Sort      | merge sort    | O(nlogn) | O(n)    | List           |

### Learn:

```
    Reminder! 
    Just practice every problem in whiteboard before coding session.
    Learn algorithmic thinking!
    Not writing code.
    You will write code looking at the picture that explains the problem
```
