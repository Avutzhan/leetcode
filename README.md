# Algorithms and DS Interview Preparation

I was learning algorithms and data structures with brute force method.
Learned, read, solved all that i found about algorithms. 

### I will try new method

* Focus on one programming language (python)
* Learn from basic topics
* Practice every topic after understanding one go to another topic
* Learn every data structure from easy to advanced
* Learn every algorithm from easy to advanced
* Learn coding interview patterns
* Practice in leetcode by topics
  * in this step you must know every ds and algo and problem-solving techniques
  * here you must just solve leetcode problems and don't have any questions about fundamentals
  * we must practice FAST problem-solving
* After this will be System Design learning path, but it is another story

### Project structure

* Learn
  * will contain all solutions
* Practice
  * will contain epmty functions that you will implement and test
  * write code and run python tests/test_name -v
* Tests
  * will contain ready tests
