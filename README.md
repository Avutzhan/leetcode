# Algorithms and DS Interview Preparation

I was learning algorithms and data structures with **Brute Force** method.
Learned, read, solved all that I found about algorithms. Brute Force not effective and quick way of learning.

I will try new method **Divide and Conquer**. This method must be quick and effective learning way.

* Focus on one programming language (python)
* Learn from basic topics
* Practice every topic after understanding one go to another topic
* Learn every data structure from easy to advanced
* Learn every algorithm from easy to advanced
* Learn coding interview patterns
* Practice in leetcode by topics
  * in this step you must know every ds and algo and problem-solving techniques
  * here you must just solve leetcode problems and don't have any questions about fundamentals
  * we must practice FAST problem-solving
* After this will be System Design learning path, but it is another story

## Project structure

* Learn
  * will contain all solutions 
  * also not efficient and slow solutions to learn from zero and step by step we will make them better
  * before every code session understand problem and explain it on whiteboard by drawing simple steps to solve
* Practice (implement and practice every day untill you can explain and implement code by yourself)
  * will contain epmty functions that you will implement and test
  * write code and run python -m unittest -v tests/test_name.py
* Tests
  * will contain ready tests
* Readme Learning path

::TODO replace with Algorithms and Data structures Roadmap (Ordered by easy to advance)

### Books:
1. Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People
   * Introduction to algorithms and data structures for beginners
   * Lists Topic Finished and Understood Completely 

### Courses:
1. Educative - Data Structures for Coding Interviews in Python
   * Fundamentals of data structures with python for beginners
   * Lists Topic Finished but not understood completely need to practice more and polish my skills
   
2. Leetcode Explore [Arrays 101](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/fun-with-arrays/)
   * After polishing last 18 lists algo-problems i will start Arrays 101 to close lists topic and start linked lists

### Data Structures:
* Lists

### Algorithms:

| # | Category  | Title         | Time     | Space   | Data Structure |
|---|-----------|---------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Search    | linear search | O(n^2)   | O(1)    | List           |
| 2 | Search    | binary search | O(logn)  | O(1)    | List           |
| 3 | Sort      | select sort   | O(n^2)   | O(n)    | List           |
| 4 | Sort      | quick sort    | O(n^2)   | O(n^2)  | List           |
| 5 | Sort      | merge sort    | O(nlogn) | O(n)    | List           |

### Learn:

```
    Reminder! 
    Just practice every problem in whiteboard before coding session.
    Learn algorithmic thinking!
    Not writing code.
    You will write code looking at the picture that explains the problem
    
    Repeat in morning and before few hours of sleep
    Repeat algorithm every day untill you polish it
    After Polishing Repeat every week
```
