268. Missing Number
Easy
Array / Math / Bit Manipulation

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space
complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

Example:
Input: [3, 0, 1]
n = 3
[0. 1. 2. 3]
Output: 2

Input: [0, 1]
n = 2
[0, 1, 2]
Output: 2
