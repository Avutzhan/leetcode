Given an array nums of n integers are there elements a b c in nums such that a + b + c = 0?
Find all unique trip;ets in the array wich gives the sum of zero

Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets

Example:
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]

solution:
[
    [-1, 0, 1],
    [-1, -1, 2],
]

TO DO
brute force 3 loops,
solve with two sum,
two sum II
