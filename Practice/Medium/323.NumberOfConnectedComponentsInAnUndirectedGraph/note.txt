Medium

Graph, DFS, Union Find

You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [a1, b1]
indicates that there is an edge between a1 and b1 in the graph

Return the number of connected components in the graph

Example:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
Output: 2
