Detect Pangram

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram,
because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not.
Ignore numbers and punctuation.

Solution
1. Format string
        delete whitespaces
        lowercase
        delete repeated chars
2. Is Panagram
        get alphabet (Py string.ascii_lowercase)
        set counter
        for each char in alphabet
            if char in alphabet
                increment counter

        if counter >= length of alphabet
            return True
        else
            return False
