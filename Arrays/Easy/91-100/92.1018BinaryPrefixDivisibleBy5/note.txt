1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5
Easy
Array

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, consider N_i: the i-th subarray
from A[0] to A[i] interpreted as a binary number (from most-significant-bit
to least-significant-bit.)

Return a list of booleans answer, where answer[i] is true if
and only if N_i is divisible by 5.
